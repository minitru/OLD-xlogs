            Hi there [[username]], 

            Your account at [[oursite]] has been created. All you need to do now is confirm this is your
            email address by clicking the link below:
            
            
            <a href='[[actiurl]]'>[[actiurl]]</a>
            
            
            You can copy and past in the url in to a new window. If that does not work then type in
            this two part code in at <a href='[[actiurl-sans-code]]'>[[actiurl-sans-code]]</a>
            
            Part A: <strong>[[parta]]</strong>
            
            Part B: <strong>[[partb]]</strong>
            
            
            Once your account is activated you can login and join the party at [[oursite]].
            
            
            Thanks
