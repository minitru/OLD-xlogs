Hi there [[username]], 

Your email address at [[oursite]] has been changed. As a security & anti spam measure you must re-activate
your account to verify you're email address.


<a href='[[actiurl]]'>[[actiurl]]</a>


You can copy and past in the url in to a new window. If that does not work then type in
this two part code in at <a href='[[actiurl-sans-code]]'>[[actiurl-sans-code]]</a>

Part A: <strong>[[parta]]</strong>
            
Part B: <strong>[[partb]]</strong>

Once your account is activated you can login at [[oursite]].

Thanks
